# Contributing (Beginner Friendly)

This repo is designed as a teaching tool. If you are new to programming,
you can still contribute by doing things like:

- Adding comments to SQL files to explain what each part does.
- Writing simple example queries in `db/queries/`.
- Improving documentation under `docs/`.

When you change something:

1. Make sure your SQL still runs (no syntax errors).
2. Add or update comments so another beginner could follow what you did.
3. Run any example scripts in `scripts/` or `clients/` that are related.
